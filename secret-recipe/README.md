Secret Family Recipes- Front End, Lambda School, Build Week October 2020

Pitch:
Everyone loves to cook and learn to cook but it is also nice to have your own cookbook, but we all love the way grandma makes it. So, why not create a recipe app that everyone in our family can be able to access the secret family recipes handed down from generation to generation without digging out the old and dusty recipe box containing little cards with handwritten notes of grandma. In this world of technology, we don’t need that old and dusty recipe box anymore, we need something secure and something to keep their recipes with us at all times!

MVP:
 Onboarding process for a new and existing users.
 Ability to enter a new recipe, including title, source (e.g. grandma ethel) ingredients, instructions, servings, etc.,
 Ability to edit or delete it later.
 Ability to search for recipes by title or tagged categories

Stretch:
 Ability to upload a picture of the original recipe along with the recipe entry. By default, all recipes uploaded can only be viewed by the registered user.
 Ability to share and invite someone with the link to view the recipe.
